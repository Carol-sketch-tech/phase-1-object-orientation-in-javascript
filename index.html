<!-- object oriented programming 
 it gives us the ability to write code that established the relationshipt between data and functions
 - note that the fundamental structure underlying all object oriented code in javascript is class.
 
 what are the benefits of object orientation.
 1. the end result of our code esxample hasnt changed.- we are still able to perform the same actions with minor midifications.
  2. Easier to change.- if we want ot add more code related to a person, instead of just adding it into a long list of functions we now have a clear logical placwe to put it.
  this make it easier to extend code.
  3. offers better data control.
  -note that using class to encapsulate our data allows us to be specific in how taht data is used.
  4. Easy to replicate.- everytime we initialize a new instance of the person class, we create a unique object.this turns out ti be of great help when dealing with many collections of similar data.
  5. Improves understanding by adding meaning.- -->
